## Purpose of a Homelab

A homelab serves as a personal environment where you can experiment, learn, and refine your skills in IT, networking, and server management. It allows you to explore new technologies, test software setups, and simulate real-world scenarios in a controlled space. Whether you're hosting services, building networks, or managing infrastructure, a homelab is a flexible and powerful tool for gaining hands-on experience and mastering the latest in technologyâ€”all from the comfort of your home.

## My use case

My homelab is designed to manage essential areas like networking, storage, and application orchestration, while also helping me learn new skills. It includes tools for handling network services, VLANs, and firewall management, alongside NFS/SMB shares for storage. Additionally, I'm using Kubernetes to explore containerized app deployment and orchestration. This setup serves as both a functional infrastructure and a learning platform for advancing my knowledge in IT and network management.
