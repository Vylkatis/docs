# My apps on Scale

This list updates daily automatically using a custom n8n workflow that [xstar](https://github.com/Xstar97TheNoob) crafted. :)

Train Descriptions:

- 📦 = System Train -> Containers the operators, the backend to many charts. 
- 👔 = Premium Train -> WIP. Full details to be announced soon.
- ✅ = Stable Train -> Contains most of our charts. These are considered stable and working.
- 🔨 = Dependency Train -> Contains charts that are mostly used as dependencies.
- ⚠️ = Incubator Train -> These Charts are still in development and/or are not considered to be of high-enough quality.
